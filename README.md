This is my website and sandbox, which I originally built on Inferno last year and am now rebuilding on React

It doesn't have anything particularly impressive going on, but it's a good reference point for me and my preferred practices when working with my preferred technologies:
- NodeJS
- React or Angular
- SASS
- Typescript
